    " As electric vehicles (EVs) gradually enter the market, there are numerous factors for consumers to consider when deciding to purchase or lease a new vehicle.\n",
    "While there are several advantages to owning an EV, such as a lower cost per mile, tax credits, reduced maintenance costs, and zero emissions, there are also other aspects to contemplate.\n",
    "These include less researched technology, regenerative braking, increased total mass, and faster acceleration.\n",
    "Considering all these factors, particularly in terms of safety, is particularly interesting.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3)\n",

    "According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EVs must meet the same safety standards as conventional vehicles and are designed with additional safety features that shut down the electrical system when necessary (which is important when thinking of the likelihood of a vehicle catching on fire).\n",
    " A study highlighted by Electrek shows that gasoline vehicles are up to 100 times more prone to fires than EVs, making EVs a safer option in this regard.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) That being said, experts are worried that certain features of EVs could pose a safety threat. \n",
    "One of those features includes the quick acceleration compared to gas vehicles.\n",
    "For those drivers who aren’t used to EVs, the acceleration could be startling, potentially causing more high-speed crashes.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) Another perspective of safety to consider is a threat to other drivers.\n",
    "The quicker acceleration and larger mass of EVs could mean more deaths on the road and more impactful accidents.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) \n",

    "There could be potential biases in our data set, because some individuals may have not chosen to report/record the accident (hit and runs, etc.), so there may not be an accurate number of total accidents in California. However, this should not be a large issue because we are handling a large number of observations such as 2,500,000, where those rare cases should become small in comparison to such a large scale. Our large number of observations should handle the issue we have identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, there could be a historical bias, in the sense that gas vehicles are more prominent and have been around longer than electric vehicles so there would be more accident reports for gas vehicles than for electric. We can handle this issue by picking a proper period where electric vehicles and gas vehicles are comparable in popularity/usage. This way, we will be narrowing our sample population so that the sample size between ev car accidents and gas car accidents are more comparable.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "There could also be a potential bias in the usage of electric vehicles since California law is very conscious about greenhouse gas emissions comapred to other states so we will be identifying the state with the most comparable sample size as stated before.  \n",

    "We will detect these specific biases before analysis by thoroughly discussing our research question prior to finding datasets and identifying any additional variables that would skew our data and affect our question. During data analysis, we will identify any points in the data that does not match up with the rest of the data and conduct additional research to identify whether those specific data points are abnormalities or whether they are biases that we did not take into account to before. Then, we will explain the abnormalities/biases in our analysis and discuss how this affects our data. After we have already written our analysis of the data, we will proof read our conclusion for any other biases that may stand out and if they do occur, we will revise and address them again. Additionally, we may conduct a peer review (if allowed) with another group so we can have unbiased feedback.    \n",
