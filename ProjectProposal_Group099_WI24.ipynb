    There could be potential biases in our data set, because some individuals may have not chosen to report/record the accident (hit and runs, etc.), so there may not be an accurate number of total accidents in California. However, this should not be a large issue because we are handling a large number of observations such as 2,500,000, where those rare cases should become small in comparison to such a large scale. Our large number of observations should handle the issue we have identified. 
    Additionally, there could be a historical bias, in the sense that gas vehicles are more prominent and have been around longer than electric vehicles so there would be more accident reports for gas vehicles than for electric. We can handle this issue by picking a proper period where electric vehicles and gas vehicles are comparable in popularity/usage. This way, we will be narrowing our sample population so that the sample size between ev car accidents and gas car accidents are more comparable. There could also be a potential bias in the usage of electric vehicles since California law is very conscious about greenhouse gas emissions so we will be identifying the state with the most comparable sample size as stated before. 
    We will detect these specific biases before analysis by thoroughly discussing our research question prior to finding datasets and identifying any additional variables that would skew our data and affect our question. During data analysis, we will identify any points in the data that does not match up with the rest of the data and conduct additional research to identify whether those specific data points are abnormalities or whether they are biases that we did not take into account to before. Then, we will explain the abnormalities/biases in our analysis and discuss how this affects our data. After we have already written our analysis of the data, we will proof read our conclusion for any other biases that may stand out and if they do occur, we will revise and address them again. Additionally, we may conduct a peer review (if allowed) with another group so we can have unbiased feedback.  
    There should not be any problems regarding data privacy, legality, or human/personal biases because the data sets have been obtained by official government publications.
