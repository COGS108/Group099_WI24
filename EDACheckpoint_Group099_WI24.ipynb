    "Over the years, advancements in car safety, including structural design improvements and technological developments, have enhanced vehicle safety.\n",
    "Despite these progressions, the frequency of car accidents has increased significantly in recent years.\n",
    "In the United States alone, there were 6,102,936 police-reported vehicle accidents in 2021<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2).\n",
    "Various factors contribute to car crashes in the US, such as distracted driving, speeding, drunk driving, reckless driving, and tailgating.\n",
    "Notably, more than a third (36%) of all fatal crashes involve alcohol<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2).\n",
    "\n",
    "These behaviors collectively contribute to the high rate of car accidents in the US, underlining the importance of addressing these issues through awareness campaigns, preventive measures, and effective policies to enhance road safety.\n",

    "Public transportation serves as a vital component of urban areas by offering consistent transportation services through modes like buses, streetcars, light rail, ferries, and subways.\n",
    "This mode of transportation is essential for diverse groups such as older adults, individuals with disabilities, and commuters, particularly in major cities where public transit is prevalent. \n",
    "Public transportation not only provides a means of travel but also contributes to health and equity in various ways.\n",
    "Research indicates that public transportation can reduce traffic accidents and air pollution while increasing physical activity and improving access to essential services like medical care, healthy food, employment opportunities, and social connections.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). \n",
    "Despite these benefits, it remains unexplored whether the utilization of public transportation correlates with the severity of car crashes in an area.\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate the relationship between public transport usage and the number and severity of car crashes in an area, one could explore how increased public transportation utilization might lead to reduced traffic congestion and fewer private vehicles on the road. \n",
    "However, it’s also possible that less traffic congestion could encourage drivers to travel at higher speeds, thus being more likely to cause a more severe/fatal accident in the area.\n",
    "Another factor to consider is that with increased public transport use, there could be more pedestrians, and therefore potentially more car-caused pedestrian injuries or deaths. \n",

    "Alternate Hypothesis: We hypothesize that higher use of public transportation lessens the number of accidents due to several factors. One of the factors being that public transportation involves professional drivers who go through rigorous training to operate the mode of transportation that they are in charge of and may adhere more strictly to traffic regulations and safety protocols which can reduce the likelihood of accidents. Therefore, they will be better experienced and equipped to handle situations that may cause accidents. Additionally, a higher usage of public transportation will result in fewer vehicles on the road which can reduce congestion and lower the probability of accidents. Thus, we hypothesize that a higher utilization of public transportation could contribute to a safer transportation environment and reduce the number of accidents on the road. In addition to this, we believe that higher use of public transportation will also lessen the severity of car accidents that occur. A higher use of public transportation indicates that there will be fewer vehicles on the road which can potentially reduce the number of reckless drivers on the road as well. Fewer reckless drivers on the road can lessen the severity of accidents. Since there are also less cars on the road, there would be less cars to crash into each other and create a 'domino effect' and involve other vehicles, thus involving less people and potentially lessening the overall severity of the entire crash. Additionally, public transportation drivers are better equipped to handle accidents as they have more training so they can better react to the situation and potentially lesssen the severity of the crash.\n",

    "Null Hypothesis: The use of public transportation does not affect the number of car crashes. It also does not affect the severity of the accident."

    "This dataset is somewhat clean. The dataset is consistent and uniform throughout. There is a small issue with completeness, as there is some missing data. \n",
    "The dataset's description states, “There is missing data for certain days, which could be due to network connectivity issues during data collection.” \n",
    "However, for the values that do remain, we are confident that they are accurate and reliable. \n",

    "Because APIs have low latency, real-time data processing, and quick response times, we can conclude that the data is precise. \n",

    "In terms of pre-processing, we will clean the data by removing any missing inputs. \n",
    "We will attempt to make the file smaller so that it can be cleaned and uploaded to GitHub. \n",
    "We have confirmed that the dataset included at least a year’s worth of data to observe trends for appropriate time frames. \n",
    "We also checked that the source was reliable. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make our data usable, we first converted the ‘Start_Time’ column into a datetime object, so that we can filter the crash data by year (2017). Within the to_datetime function, we specified errors = ‘coerce’ to better handle improper formatted or mixed date strings in the dataframe. Then, we filtered the state to just be California, and the year to just be 2017 (using dt.year). Then, we selected the columns ‘Start_Time’, ‘Severity’, ‘City’, and ‘Description’, and sorted the dataframe by Start_Time, while also resetting the index.  \n",

    "We had full control of the quality of the data set. We made sure all the data was consistent and complete.\n",
    "We ensured the credibility of the data, by making sure it was taken from a reputable source like the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey.\n",
    "Unfortunately, the data may have small holes in precision, as survey participation is often voluntary.\n",
    "However, the source states that certain cities “were ranked the previous year but did not have sufficient data or population for the most recent rankings.”\n",
    "From this we can conclude that the source has only published results that had solid data to support it, thus making the research conducted accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of pre-processing, we cleaned the data as we entered it into our dataset. We checked that it included at least a year’s worth of data to observe trends for appropriate time frames.\n",

    "There should not be an issue with any biases from the source of collection as the dataset that we are exmaining the data from takes the data from multiple APIs which broadcast traffic data which is captured from various sources, including the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, trafic cameras, and trafic sensors within road network. This should allow us to avoid any biases as there are many sources of information that went into this dataset which can validate each other. Additionally, as some of the data is taken in from traffic cameras and sensors, the data is inputted by a machine/algorithm which will remove human biases.\n",

    "However, there may be biases in which accidents were reported to the government as there may be racial/ethical biases when it came to reporting the accidents to the government.\n",
    "This may exclude certain demographics of people or target others, but as we are not focusing on race/demographics, it should not affect our data analysis as much. Additionally, since the data is vastly spread across the country and over the time frame of 2016 - 2013, the data should even out itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "One factor we may fail to fully consider is the location and its impact on each accident.\n",
    "For example, there may be weather conditions or other variables that we are unable to record that may be the main reason for the accident, yet we concluded a different reasoning with the information we analyzed.\n",
    "However, this should still be acceptable as the main goal of our hypothesis and research is to find out how certain factors consistently result in an accident.\n",

    "We will detect these specific biases before analysis by thoroughly discussing our research question before finding datasets and identifying any additional variables that would skew our data and affect our question.\n",
    "During data analysis, we will identify any points in the data that do not match up with the rest of the data and conduct additional research to identify whether those specific data points are abnormalities or whether they are biases that we did not take into account before.\n",
    "Then, we will explain the abnormalities/biases in our analysis and discuss how this affects our data.\n",
    "After we have already written our analysis of the data, we will proofread our conclusion for any other biases that may stand out and if they do occur, we will revise and address them again.\n",

This includes any distinguishing features about the vehicles involved in the accident. \n",
