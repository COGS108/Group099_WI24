    "Over the years, cars have become safer whether it be through improvements in structural design or the development of new technologies.\n",
    "Despite such progressions, however, the frequency of car accidents has risen significantly over the last several years.\n",
    "These include less researched technology, regenerative braking, increased total mass, and faster acceleration.\n",
    "Specifically, there were 6,102,936 police-reported vehicle accidents in the United States in just the year 2021 itself<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the factors influencing car crashes in the United States are quite diverse. Accidents can be the result of negative behaviors such as distracted driving, speeding, drunk driving, reckless driving, and tailgating<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1).\n",
    "In fact, more than a third (36%) of all fatal crashes involve alcohol<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3).\n",

    "Accidents can even correlate to variables as general as the state one is in, to those as specific as the month, day, and even hour. For instance, there is previous work that has been done to analyze the frequency of car crashes based on days and times of the week.\n",
    "This analysis was conducted by NSC, which used data from 2021 and analyzed the frequency of fatal and non-fatal car crashes based on the time of the day and week.\n",
    "They concluded that for warmer months (spring and summer), fatal crashes peaked in the late evening and night (8 p.m. and midnight), meanwhile, for winter and early spring, the fatal crashes peaked between 4 and 8 p.m.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2)\n",
    "Another observation that could be extracted from their analysis is that more crashes tended to happen closer to the end of the week (Friday to Sunday). This will be interesting to contrast with our analysis later on to see if it’s consistent with our findings for the years 2016-2020.\n",
