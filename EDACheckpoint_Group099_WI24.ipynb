    "Over the years, advancements in car safety, including structural design improvements and technological developments, have enhanced vehicle safety.\n",
    "Despite these progressions, the frequency of car accidents has increased significantly in recent years.\n",
    "In the United States alone, there were 6,102,936 police-reported vehicle accidents in 2021<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2).\n",
    "Various factors contribute to car crashes in the US, such as distracted driving, speeding, drunk driving, reckless driving, and tailgating.\n",
    "Notably, more than a third (36%) of all fatal crashes involve alcohol<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2).\n",
    "\n",
    "These behaviors collectively contribute to the high rate of car accidents in the US, underlining the importance of addressing these issues through awareness campaigns, preventive measures, and effective policies to enhance road safety.\n",

    "Public transportation serves as a vital component of urban areas by offering consistent transportation services through modes like buses, streetcars, light rail, ferries, and subways.\n",
    "This mode of transportation is essential for diverse groups such as older adults, individuals with disabilities, and commuters, particularly in major cities where public transit is prevalent. \n",
    "Public transportation not only provides a means of travel but also contributes to health and equity in various ways.\n",
    "Research indicates that public transportation can reduce traffic accidents and air pollution while increasing physical activity and improving access to essential services like medical care, healthy food, employment opportunities, and social connections.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). \n",
    "Despite these benefits, it remains unexplored whether the utilization of public transportation correlates with the severity of car crashes in an area.\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate the relationship between public transport usage and the number and severity of car crashes in an area, one could explore how increased public transportation utilization might lead to reduced traffic congestion and fewer private vehicles on the road. \n",
    "However, it’s also possible that less traffic congestion could encourage drivers to travel at higher speeds, thus being more likely to cause a more severe/fatal accident in the area.\n",
    "Another factor to consider is that with increased public transport use, there could be more pedestrians, and therefore potentially more car-caused pedestrian injuries or deaths. \n",

    "Alternate Hypothesis: We hypothesize that higher use of public transportation lessens the number of accidents due to several factors. One of the factors being that public transportation involves professional drivers who go through rigorous training to operate the mode of transportation that they are in charge of and may adhere more strictly to traffic regulations and safety protocols which can reduce the likelihood of accidents. Therefore, they will be better experienced and equipped to handle situations that may cause accidents. Additionally, a higher usage of public transportation will result in fewer vehicles on the road which can reduce congestion and lower the probability of accidents. Thus, we hypothesize that a higher utilization of public transportation could contribute to a safer transportation environment and reduce the number of accidents on the road. In addition to this, we believe that higher use of public transportation will also lessen the severity of car accidents that occur. A higher use of public transportation indicates that there will be fewer vehicles on the road which can potentially reduce the number of reckless drivers on the road as well. Fewer reckless drivers on the road can lessen the severity of accidents. Since there are also less cars on the road, there would be less cars to crash into each other and create a 'domino effect' and involve other vehicles, thus involving less people and potentially lessening the overall severity of the entire crash. Additionally, public transportation drivers are better equipped to handle accidents as they have more training so they can better react to the situation and potentially lesssen the severity of the crash.\n",

    "Null Hypothesis: The use of public transportation does not affect the number of car crashes. It also does not affect the severity of the accident."

    "This dataset is somewhat clean. The dataset is consistent and uniform throughout. There is a small issue with completeness, as there is some missing data. \n",
    "The dataset's description states, “There is missing data for certain days, which could be due to network connectivity issues during data collection.” \n",
    "However, for the values that do remain, we are confident that they are accurate and reliable. \n",
    "In the description, it states “The data was collected from APIs broadcast traffic data captured by various entities, including the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road networks.” \n",
    "Because APIs have low latency, real-time data processing, and quick response times, we can conclude that the data is precise. \n",
    "We can also conclude from this excerpt that the sources are credible and trustworthy.\n",

    "Getting the data into a usable format was very difficult. The downloaded file was very large so at first we were unable to upload it to GitHub properly due to storage limitations. \n",
    "Even when loading the file into Excel or Visual Studio Code, the file was very heavy and laggy. We had to condense and clean the file many times to be able to finally upload and wrangle the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of pre-processing, we will clean the data by removing any missing inputs. \n",
    "We will attempt to make the file smaller so that it can be cleaned and uploaded to GitHub. \n",
    "We have confirmed that the dataset included at least a year’s worth of data to observe trends for appropriate time frames. \n",
    "We also checked that the source was reliable. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset #2\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is very clean. This is mainly because we created our own data set. Thus, we had full control over what variables, observations, and units of measurement were included.\n",
    "We had full control of the quality of the data set. We made sure all the data was consistent and complete.\n",
    "We ensured the credibility of the data, by making sure it was taken from a reputable source like the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey.\n",
    "Unfortunately, the data may have small holes in precision, as survey participation is often voluntary.\n",
    "However, the source states that certain cities “were ranked the previous year but did not have sufficient data or population for the most recent rankings.”\n",
    "From this we can conclude that the source has only published results that had solid data to support it, thus making the research conducted accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the data into a usable format we had to take research and statistics from various websites related to our study.\n",
    "We then had to transform the file type twice. First, we inputted data into an Excel spreadsheet for ease of viewing and editing.\n",
    "Second, we converted the file into a CSV to be read by pandas.\n",

    "In terms of pre-processing, we cleaned the data as we entered it into our dataset. We checked that it included at least a year’s worth of data to observe trends for appropriate time frames.\n",
