    "Over the years, cars have become safer whether it be through improvements in structural design or the development of new technologies.\n",
    "Despite such progressions, however, the frequency of car accidents has risen significantly over the last several years.\n",
    "These include less researched technology, regenerative braking, increased total mass, and faster acceleration.\n",
    "Specifically, there were 6,102,936 police-reported vehicle accidents in the United States in just the year 2021 itself<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the factors influencing car crashes in the United States are quite diverse. Accidents can be the result of negative behaviors such as distracted driving, speeding, drunk driving, reckless driving, and tailgating<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1).\n",
    "In fact, more than a third (36%) of all fatal crashes involve alcohol<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3).\n",
    "All of these factors contribute to the high rate of car accidents in the US, making it crucial for individuals and authorities to address these issues through awareness, preventive measures, and effective policies to improve road safety. \n",
    "\n",
    "Accidents can even correlate to variables as general as the state one is in, to those as specific as the month, day, and even hour. For instance, there is previous work that has been done to analyze the frequency of car crashes based on days and times of the week.\n",
    "This analysis was conducted by NSC, which used data from 2021 and analyzed the frequency of fatal and non-fatal car crashes based on the time of the day and week.\n",
    "They concluded that for warmer months (spring and summer), fatal crashes peaked in the late evening and night (8 p.m. and midnight), meanwhile, for winter and early spring, the fatal crashes peaked between 4 and 8 p.m.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2)\n",
    "Another observation that could be extracted from their analysis is that more crashes tended to happen closer to the end of the week (Friday to Sunday). This will be interesting to contrast with our analysis later on to see if itâ€™s consistent with our findings for the years 2016-2020.\n",

    "Alternate Hypothesis: We hypothesize that higher use of public transportation lessens the number of accidents due to several factors. One of the factors being that public transportation involves professional drivers who go through rigorous training to operate the mode of transportation that they are in charge of and may adhere more strictly to traffic regulations and safety protocols which can reduce the likelihood of accidents. Therefore, they will be better experienced and equipped to handle situations that may cause accidents. Additionally, a higher usage of public transportation will result in fewer vehicles on the road which can reduce congestion and lower the probability of accidents. Thus, we hypothesize that a higher utilization of public transportation could contribute to a safer transportation environment and reduce the number of accidents on the road.\n",
